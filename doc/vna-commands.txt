Text command documentation in VNA

The serial text command interface is intended to be a way to interface to the VNA
that does not depend on the availability of any other hardware that may be
unavailable in the future.

The device enumerates as a USB CDC serial port.  Using the arduino terminal, or
other terminal software (e.g. Teraterm or minicom), or by directly opening the
serial port, these commands may be used to acquire data from the VNA.  Uppercase
or lowercase are both acceptable for the commands.


Example command sequence:

SETACQ 80 3000000 30000000        Set up acquisition of 80 frequencies between
                                  3 and 30 MHz.  Any existing calibration state in
								  RAM is invalidated.
								  
OPEN                              Do an open circuit calibration (no load on port 1)

SHORT                             Do a short circuit calibration (short circuit load
                                  on port 1)
								  
LOAD 50                           Do a 50 ohm load calibration on port 1.  Connect
                                  50 ohm resistor for port 1.
								  After this step, 1 port calibration is complete.
								  
TWOCAL                            Do a two-port calibration.  Connect port 1 to port 2
                                  and execute the command.
                                  After this step, 2 port calibration is complete.
								  
WRITECAL 1                        Write calibration state to flash slot 1

LISTCAL                           List all calibration states in flash to verify it is
                                  written
								  
READCAL 1                         Read back calibration state from flash slot 1 (not
                                  necessary at this step, just here as an example)
								  
CSV 1                             Turn on comma-separated-values mode (optional)

ACQ                               After attaching a load, acquire data.  Displays
                                  impedance of load on port 1 and thru impedance
								  between port 1 and port 2
								  
SPARM                             Acquire data and show S11 (reflection dB and phase)
                                  and S21 (transmission dB and phase) 

								  
Commands:

								  
SETACQ <number of frequencies> <lowest frequency> <highest frequency>

Set the frequency range for which data acquisition occurs.  Note that this invalidates
any calibration performed so that the calibration sequence must be performed before
data acquisition can occur.

<number of frequencies> - the number of frequencies over the band to sample, up to 80
<lowest frequency> - lowest frequency in the band to sample
<highest frequency> - highest frequency in the band to sample

For example, to set up to sample 80 frequencies over the HF band, 
"SETACQ 80 3000000 30000000"


ACQ

Acquire data, given a valid calibration, using the frequencies set up in the SETACQ
command.  This measures the impedance of the load on port 1, and the series impedance
between port 1 and port 2.  Thru impedance is only shown if there is a valid
2-port calibration.  If CSV format is used, the output is
<frequency>,<load resistance on port 1>,<load reactance on port 1>,<thru resistance port 1 to 2>,<thru reactance port 1 to 2>


SPARM

Acquire data, given a valid calibration, using the frequencies set up in the SETACQ
command.  This measures the dB and phase of the S11 reflection on port 1, and the dB
and phase of the transmission between port 1 and port 2.  Phase is given in -180 to
180 degrees.  The S21 is shown only if there is a valid 2-port calibration.
If CSV format is used, the output is
<frequency>,<S11 dB>,<S11 phase>,<S21 dB>,<S21 phase>


IMACQ <number of frequencies> <lowest frequency> <highest frequency>

Immediately acquires raw sample data from both ports.  This does not require a
valid calibration to work.  Outputs data to terminal.  The raw output is intended for
those who would rather do all of the processing of the data using an external program.
If comma-separated-value (CSV) format is used (highly recommended) the following
format is used:

<frequency>,<port 1 volt in-phase>,<port 1 volt quadrature-phase>,<port 1 current in-phase>,<port 1 current quadrature phase>,<port 2 current in-phase>,<port 2 current quadrature phase>

<number of frequencies> - the number of frequencies over the band to sample
<lowest frequency> - lowest frequency in the band to sample
<highest frequency> - highest frequency in the band to sample

For example, to immediately sample 200 frequencies over the HF band, 
"IMACQ 200 3000000 30000000"


DOACQ

The same as IMACQ, except uses the frequency range set by SETACQ, so this does not need
parameters.


OPEN

Begin 1 port calibration process.  With an open circuit on port 1, acquire open port part
of calibration.


SHORT

Only after OPEN port calibration, short circuit port 1, and acquire short circuit
part of calibration.  If you are calibrating two ports, short circuit port 2 as well
at this time.


LOAD <impedance>

Only after SHORT port calibration, apply a load of impedance <impedance> (usually 50 ohms)
to the port.  After this step, 1 port calibration is complete.


TWOCAL 

Connect port 1 to port 2 and acquire thru part of calibration.  After this step, 2 port
calibration is complete.


AVERAGES <# averages> <timeout>

Change the number of averages for data acquisition.  The default is 64 averages.  More
averages take longer but get a less noisy result.  The <timeout> is the timeout of the
data acquisition in milliseconds, usually 1000 ms.  You can use more averages when
calibrating to get a more accurate calibration than when acquiring data.


CSV <csv state>

Turn on or off comma-separated-values mode.  <csv state>=0 turn off, <csv state>=1 turn on.
Comma-separated-values mode is intended to be easier to parse, or able to be loaded
into spreadsheet software for further processing.


ATTEN <attenuation state>
Set the state of the attenuator.  The value <attenuation state> has the following meaning:
0 = automatic, 1 = attenuator off, 2 = attenuator on.


LISTCAL

List all of the calibration states in the flash.  There are currently 8 slots,
numbered 1 to 8, for calibration states.  Each calibration state uses 4k of flash memory.


WRITECAL <slot #>

Write the current calibration state, either 1 or 2 port, into the corresponding
flash slot <slot #>.  This saves the state of the VNA calibration and frequency ranges
to the slot.


READCAL <slot #>

Read back the calibration state from the flash into the RAM from slot <slot #>.  It
is advised for the most accurate results, the calibration be performed immediately
preceding measurement, but for rough results, like checking an antenna, a saved
calibration is probably good enough.
